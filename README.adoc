The goal of Chessica is to provide a tool to play a chess game between two players.
Chessica drives the game and asks for the move from the respective player.

A player can come in various flavors:
* ConsoleInputPlayer - a player enters their next move in the console
* RandomMovePlayer - a player which does a random move
* WebUIPlayer - a player which can enter their moves via a Web frontend
* UCIEnginePlayer - a player which wraps a chess engine conforming to the UCI protocol
